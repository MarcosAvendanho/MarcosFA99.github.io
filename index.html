                        "I don't know if I will become world champion, but if I have reached the middle of the road with
                        4 podiums from Spain, I will not stop now." he comments in one of his interviews.<br>
                        Marcos has made numerous exhibitions at GALIEXPO, one of the most important motor fairs in

                        Making exhibitions at fairgrounds, such as IFEVI where 30,000 people attended in 2018, and
                        improving exponentially
                        every year, Its objective is to publicize the sport throughout Spain, since in Galicia / Vigo,
                        where he lives is very little known
                        Therefore, their training is very intensive to leave the public speechless and get more deceit.
